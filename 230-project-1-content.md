# Wizard Wisdom

## High Concept
It's Jeopardy meets Asteroids!

## Genre
Multi-directional trivia shooter.

## Platform
Web for desktop.

## Story
In Wizard Wisdom, you play as an aged wizard who must protect years of magical research from falling into the hands of the army of the dead. To defeat the invading army, you must use your knowledge of the mystical arts against them. But be careful, old age has tarnished your perfect memory. Can you remember important wizard lore to defeat all of your enemies in time? Can you survive the chaos as more and more enemies are thrown into your path? Or will the army of the dead steal your research and use it for evil? The choice is yours in this chaotic, mystical, last-stand against evil!

## Esthetics
Wizard Wisdom will consist of a cartoon graphics style. Both the wizard and attacking forces will be represented with a Chibi style, meaning their bodies are smaller than their heads. The sound in the game will be relatively simple, in 8-bit. However, there will be sounds for correct/incorrect answers to trivia questions, background music, and winning/losing sounds.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
Players of Wizard Wisdom are given a few options in terms of gameplay and its mechanics. The first is the ability to move around the screen to avoid enemies. This will be allowed through the use of the arrow keys and WASD. However, avoiding enemies to prevent a gameover is not the main goal of the game. The goal is to defeat all invading enemies by aiming and shooting from your staff with the mouse. This is where the next mechanic comes into play, answering trivia. In order to remember a spell for attacking, the player must answer a multiple choice trivia question pertaining to wizard lore. When a player presses spacebar, a question will pop up and can be answered using 1-4 on the keyboard. If the question was answered correctly, the player will be notified and can then shoot and defeat an enemy in any direction. Otherwise, the player will again be notified and must press spacebar for another question. If an enemy reaches the wizard's research, then it is gameover.

### Controls
- keyboard:
  - WASD/arrow keys - move around the screen
  - spacebar - creates a trivia question that helps remember an attack spell
  - p/P - pauses the game
  - 1-4 - answers a trivia question
 - mouse:
   - aim & right click - fires an attack spell, if one has been remembered
  
### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
In order to teach new players the game, there will be a portion of text in the corner of the screen with information on how to play. This could be in the form of a box of information. It would also be distinguishable from the game itself to prevent distractions
 
### Player Learning
The player is going to need to learn a few things in order to beat the game. The first and most important is timing. Since the player can only attack when attack spells have been remembered, it will be important to time their attacks accordingly. For example, if an enemy is getting close to the research, it is important to be aware of that and remember an attack spell in advance. It is also important to be aware of enemies around the player to avoid being caught off guard, since it would take too much time to answer a question before taking a hit. Another important thing to learn is pacing. As time goes on, more and more enemies will spawn, so pacing oneself is key to beating the invading forces. Lastly, the player will need to learn that the goal isn't to survive the enemies, but to protect the research. Although movement is allowed for more engaging play, if an enemy touches the research, it is game over. So it is critical to keep the research location in mind and guard it as well as one can.

## Other
Wizard Wisdom is very similar to the game Asteroids in that the player is allowed to move around the screen to attack enemies. However, enemies are moving towards the wizard's research, which is in the center of the screen. The game is also similar to the game Jeopardy in that the player must answer trivia to advance through the game. However, the trivia is multiple choice and not the primary focus of the game, although the game couldn't progress without it.

## About the developer
My name is Alexander Stevens and I am a fourth year Game Design student at Rochester Institute of Technology. Over the years I have become proficient in Java, various C languages such as C# and C++, as well as applications such as Photoshop, Maya, Unity, and Unreal Engine. However, some of my preferred interests lie specifically in programming through Unity and making 3D models in Maya. The freedom that these two applications allow you, whether it be creating anything from my imagination or programming real-life physics, is what makes these activities some of my favorite to pursue.
